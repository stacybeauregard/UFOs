## UFO Challenge

### Overview of Analysis

  Dana has asked for our help in creating a website that organizes UFO sightings from around the US. She would like to create a dynamic website to be able to filter this data by various criteria. 
  
### Results
 
When first visiting the webpage, Dana has added a header and a few paragraphs debating the idea of aliens exisiting. Below this introduction is the table from which we can search the data Dana has collected. This is an image of the top of the webpage that we have created with Dana:

At first glance, this webpage is overwhelmed with UFO sightings from across the country. We created several filters by which the data can be narrowed down and more manageable. In order to do this, simply input your search parameters into each text box and hit the tab button, enter, or click outside the box. This is what the table looks like when no filtering has been applied:

And this is the table after filtering by the city of "el cajon" and the state of "ca"

To reset the page and search again, you can type over the previous entries or scroll to the top of the page and click "UFO Sightings" in the upper left corner.
 
 ### Summary
 1. Drawback
 
 While our website is looking pretty great and we can definitely filter our data, we are only allowed to enter one criteria per filter, and we have to guess as to what is available. There is also only the option of inputting an exact data for the sightings.
 
 2. Suggestions
 
 * I suggest that Dana alter the filters so that instead of being free text where the user must guess as to what information is available she creates a tree or drop down menu that will allow for the selection of pre-fixed parameters that are available. This way a user can choose more than one option as well as currently you can only input one search criteria per filter.
 
 * My next suggestion would be to open up the date filter to be a range of dates or have a dropdown or tree feature that shows what dates are available and allows the user to select as many dates as they wish.
